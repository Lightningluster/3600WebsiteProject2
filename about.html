      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        I was born in Napa California in 2003. I lived there for most of my life, until COVID happened. We moved that summer, in the midst of everything, and suddenly I was stuck in my senior year of highschool repeating content from early middle school. 
        Luckily I managed to land an internship out of graduation at the local library, but after taking a gap year trying to work I realised I needed a degree to do something I actually enjoyed. The University of Idaho sounded like it had a great CS program, so I ended up going here.

      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p>
        Clearly, I have the ability to do basic coding. I also have rudimentary experience in lots of things, like 3D animation, 3D modeling, photoshop, video editing, creative writing, scene writing, and some sick gamer skills.

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        I think it would be really cool to get an A in CS 3600 this semester. I think the Professor and TA are like pretty cool or whatever, so hopefully I can get my stuff working with ease and give them an easy time.
