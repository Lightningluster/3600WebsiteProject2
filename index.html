      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you for visiting my site. For now, this is just where I post some
        <strong>Videos.</strong>. 
        Hopefully you think they're as cool as I do. I spent a lot of time and a long period of my life making them, and I did so because something made me feel a certain way.

      <h2>Purpose of This Website</h2>
      <p>
        This website was made for the CS3600 class at University of Idaho. I am not here of my own volition. Its fun messing around with HTML and all, but doing this on github just to host a site means I don't get to do a lot of the fun stuff I still want to learn...

      <h2>Future Plans</h2>
      <p>
        I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to expand on this website at some point, but I haven't read the specifics yet. Hopefully it'll be fun, and maybe I'll get to mess around with more languages.
